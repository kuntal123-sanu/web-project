<p><b>An applicant’s knowledge, skills, abilities, and other attributes are the most commonly measured variables when interviewers assess Person-job fit. In one survey, all interviewers reported that their organization measures KSAOs to determine Person-job fit.The same study found that all interviewers used personality traits and 65% of the interviewers used personal values to measure Person-organization fit.
Despite fit being a concern among organizations, how to determine fit and the types of questions to use varies. When interview fit questions were examined, only 4% of the questions used in interviews were similar across the majority of organizations. 22% of questions were commonly used by recruiters in some organizations. In contrast, 74% of the questions had no commonality between organizations.Although the idea of fit is similar in many organizations, the questions used and how that information is judged may be very different.
Person-job fit and Person-organization fit have different levels of importance at different stages of a multi stage interview proves. Despite this, Person-job fit is considered of highest importance throughout the entire process. Organizations focus more on job related skills early on to screen out potential unqualified candidates. Thus, more questions are devoted to Person-job fit during the initial interview stages.Once applicants have passed the initial stages, more questions are used for Person-organization fit in the final interview stages. Although there is more focus on Person-organization fit in these later stages, Person-job fit is still considered to be of greater importance.
In a single stage interview, both fits are assessed during a single interview.Interviewers still put more weight on Person-job fit questions over the Person-organization questions in these situations as well. Again, Person-job fit questions are used to screen out and reduce the number of applicants.
